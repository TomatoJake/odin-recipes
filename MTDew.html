	<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
		<p>In one of my most dissapointing moments in life I tried making Sprite as a kid with my grandma. Im sure this will be just as disapointing. I don't think the lord intended his flock to create <em>green liquid</em>.</p>
	<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 gallon carbonated water</li>
			<li>3 cups sugar</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
			<li>1/2 cup lemon juice </li>
			<li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
			<li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
			<li>1 cup water</li>
			<li>1/2 orange peel</li>
			<li>1/2 lime peel</li>
			<li>1/2 lemon peel</li>
		</ul>	
	<p><h2>Steps</h2></p>	
		<ol>
			<li>Combine your cream of tartar, sugar, and a cup of water. </li>
			<li>Place it on a pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Once it starts boiling, lower the heat and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes. Then, turn off the heat and let it cool.</li>
			<li>Once your mixture is cool, separately boil another cup of water. Add in the fruit peels and remove from the heat. Cover and set aside, allowing it to steep. Once it has reached room temperature, you need to strain it.</li>
			<li>Add the citrus peel water to the sugar mixture. Blend them all together and add in carbonated water. Mix gently to combine. Once everything has dissolved, it is completely mixed and ready to drink. </li>
		</ol>
